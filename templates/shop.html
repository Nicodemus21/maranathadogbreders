<div class='products shop-products'> <h2>Most Affordable Electric Vehicles</h2> <div class='center pc' data-flickity='{"contain": true, "watchCSS": true}'> <div class='product' data-desc=' Renault Twizy is the cheapest EV on the market today. It’s also one of the smallest ‘cars’ ever. While the measly 17bhp and woeful top speed of 50mph may put a lot of people off, Renault claims it costs just £1 to fully charge, putting a lot of people on. It has a long charging process - three and a half hours - which then allows drivers to travel for up to 62 miles. However, don’t expect to get much more than 50 miles in the real world.

<div class='product' data-desc='There are two battery packs for drivers to choose from. The first is a 39kWh unit which can manage up to 180 miles if driven very gingerly. But it’s the larger, more expensive 64kWh versions that would be our choice, because they provide the Kona with a driving range of up to 279 miles. Unsurprisingly, when fitted with the more powerful motor that comes with the larger battery, the attention-grabbing five-seat crossover is pretty fleet-footed. It can scoot from 0-62mph in just 7.6 seconds.
